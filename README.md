Important Note About TMDB API Access
The app uses REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN = <The Movie Database Access Token> to access TMDB API.

Known Issue: On some networks (particularly Jio in India), TMDB API access may be restricted. Users might only see the home page without full UI functionality.

Workarounds:
Use a VPN - Switch to a VPN service to bypass network restrictions

Change DNS - Use Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8)

These solutions should restore full access to all app features.
